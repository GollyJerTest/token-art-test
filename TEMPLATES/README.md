# TEMPLATES

This folder contains a sample collection configuration file that can be used to create new collection configs. To submit a new collection config:

1. Submit a ticket to request addition of your collection
2. Verify you are a collection owner or authority with the admins
3. Clone this repository (if you haven't already)
4. Copy the collection config template to `/blockchains/{chain name}/{collection name}` directory (if this hasn't been set up yet, submit a ticket)
5. Edit the collection config with your collection details, then commit your changes to trigger a pull request
