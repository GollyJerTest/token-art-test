This repository contains NFT collection configurations used by by the
[token.art](https://token.art?from=github) to provide token categorization details for NFTs that
don't have this information on-chain.

These configurations help organize NFTs into collections and provide additional details such as
artist credits, custom collection icons, descriptions and more!

The goal, and token.art's mission, is to make the collector experience more enjoyable.

<br />

## Contributing
You can be a collection "owner" or "curator" and help us keep the collection configurations up to
date.

- If a collection configuration doesn't yet exist, reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TokenArtApp) or
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/NCBg4a4ddY) to discuss. We will create a
  configuration folder in the repo.
- Create a github account if you don't have one already.
- Navigate to https://github.dev/AwesomeLabs/token-art-test. An editor environment will be launched.   
- In the file explorer, navigate to the `collections` folder and click on the json file.
- You can edit the json file by hand, or use our [configurator
  tool](https://awesomelabs.github.io/token-art/collection-configurator/) to generate and then paste
  in the json file.
